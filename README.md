Tiny Tiny RSS client for Android
================================

This is a fork of the original Tiny Tiny RSS client for Android by [gothfox](https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS-for-Honeycomb).
The current goal is to combine recent work of other forks with polish to the UI and UX. If possible fixes and additions will be provided upstream as pull request.
